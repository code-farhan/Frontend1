        %p Replace our inferred setup commands with your own bash commands. Dependency overrides run instead of our inferred commands for dependency installation. If our inferred commands are not to your liking, replace them here. Use this to override the specific pre-test commands we run, such as <code>bundle install</code>, <code>rvm use</code>, <code>ant build</code>, <code>configure</code>, <code>make</code>, etc.
