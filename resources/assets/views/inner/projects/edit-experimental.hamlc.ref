    Experimental Settings
  %p
    We've got a few settings you can play with, to enable things we're working
    on. We'd love to
    != succeed '.', () ->
      %a{data-bind: "click: $root.raiseIntercomDialog"} know what you think about them

    These <em>are</em> works-in-progress, though, and there may be some
    sharp edges. Be careful!
  %ul
    != @describe_flag "build_GH1157_container_oriented_ui", |
      "Container-Oriented Build Page", ->                   |
      We're looking at optimizing our build page for builds with large
      numbers of containers. With this option set, the build actions
      are separated into tabbed subpages corresponding to each container.

      Note that this will only apply to builds run while this setting is
      enabled -- it won't change old build pages.

        %img{width: 600, src: assetPath('(asset-path "img/container-oriented.png")')}

    != @describe_flag "junit", "JUnit Support", ->
      We've been experimenting with better ways to display and manage
      test result data, especially for large test suites. This adds flags
      to some of our inferred commands, and collects data supplied by JUnit and
      JUnit-compatabile test runners. It only works for a handful of test
      runners for now, and the data is only available through our API, though!

    != @describe_flag "set-github-status", "GitHub Status Updates", ->
      By default, we update the status of every pushed commit with
      GitHub's status API. If you'd like to turn this off (if, for example,
      this is conflicting with another service), you can do so below.

    != @describe_flag "oss", "Free and Open Source", ->
      Be part of our F/OSS beta! Organizations now have a free container
      reserved for F/OSS projects; enabling this will allow this project's
      builds to use it and let others see your builds, both through the
      web UI and the API.
