      %h3 Tight GitHub integration
      %p When practicing continuous delivery you always want the build green. Circle tests GitHub Pull Requests, branches and forks, so you always know when code is ready to ship. Circle takes care of managing SSH keys and permissions, so you can get back to work. If a collaborator can see the project in GitHub, they can see it in Circle.

      %h3 Debug With Ease
      %p Don't waste time debugging why your tests failed. Circle allows you to SSH into a running build and reproduce test failures in real time.  Circle provides copious documentation, and in-app messages for common problems.

      %h3 More Speed
      %p Circle can split your tests among multiple VM at the click of a button. Run your tests up to 16x faster, on our already fast VMs. And run multiple builds at once, so you never have to wait on a colleague's build.

      %h3 Smart Notifications
      %p Get notified of test results through email, hipchat, campfire, flowdock and IRC, or through GitHub Pull Requests and Branch Status. Intelligent notification preferences mean you only get notified for builds that are important for you.

        %h3 Deploy Anywhere
        %p When the tests pass, deploy easily to Heroku, AWS, EngineYard, Nodejitsu, Google App Engine, or to your own server, using capistrano, fabric or your own bash commands.

        %h3 Convention Over Configuration
        %p When your project follows best-practices, Circle can set up your project in three clicks. We'll install dependencies, configure databases and run your tests. For more complex setups, anything can be tweaked through the Circle site, or through a config file in your repo.
