  You can run Selenium WebDriver tests with Sauce Labs on CircleCI using Sauce Labs'
  secure tunnel,
  %a{href: "https://docs.saucelabs.com/reference/sauce-connect/"}
    Sauce Connect.
  Sauce Connect allows you to run a test server within the CircleCI build container
  and expose it it (using a URL like
  %code localhost:8080
  ) to Sauce Labs' browsers. If you
  run your browser tests after deploying to a publicly accessible staging environment,
  then you can use Sauce Labs in the usual way without worrying about Sauce Connect.

%p
  This example
  %code circle.yml
  file demonstrates how to run browser tests through Sauce Labs against a test
  server running within a CircleCI build container.
