  We designed our UI so that it is easy for you to upload the SSH keys we need
  to securely deploy your projects to your production servers.

%p
  You enter the security information (public key and private key) for deployment
  on your project's <b>Project Settings > SSH keys</b> page.
  If you leave the <b>Hostname</b> field blank, the key will be used for all hosts.
