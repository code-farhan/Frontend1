%p
  This is caused by using jars that were AOT compiled against
  1.2.1 or lower, with Clojure 1.3 or higher. The most frequent
  offender is clojure-contrib, which is not compatible with
  Clojure 1.3+.

%p
  If this works on your (OSX) machine but fails on CircleCI, it also
  means you are running two different clojure versions at the same
  time.

%p
  To determine whether you are loading two different clojure.jars,
  look in lib/, and lib/dev/. If you are, fix this issue before
  trying to upgrade dependencies. Typically, you'll need to add
  exclusions to the dependency that requires clojure 1.2. The
  dependency in your project.clj will look like:

%code [org.foo/bar \"1.0.0\" :exclusions [org.clojure/clojure]]

%p
  To find jars that depend on clojure 1.2, you can use the command

%code lein pom && mvn dependency:tree

%p
  To fix the KeywordLookupSite error, look at your dependencies,
  and upgrade them as appropriate. The easiest way to determine
  whether they work in clojure 1.3 is to a repl via
  %code lein repl
  or
  %code lein swank
  and start requiring libraries until you find one that doesn't compile.
