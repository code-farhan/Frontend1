%p
  We provide project and branch status images, which you can embed anywhere you want: a GitHub
  README, a dashboard, or anywhere else you can imagine!

%p
  Here's our current build status:
  %img{ src: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle.png?circle-token=3cc80b12ab3627373c76e13735b8bc00a1259b9e" }

%p
  The status images are also available in "shield" style:
  %img{ src: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/circle.svg?style=shield&circle-token=3cc80b12ab3627373c76e13735b8bc00a1259b9e" }

%p
  You can use a simple image URL like this to see the status of your project's default branch:

  %code
    https://circleci.com/gh/:owner/:repo.png?circle-token=:circle-token
  %br
  %code
    https://circleci.com/gh/:owner/:repo.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token

%p
  For example:
  circleci/mongofinil
  %a{ href: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil.png?circle-token=b14acf911433d315298235b0c2fbf7b2670a92a8" }
    badge
  and
  %a{ href: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil.svg?&style=shield&circle-token=b14acf911433d315298235b0c2fbf7b2670a92a8" }
    shield

%p
  Or you can see the status of any specific branch:

  %code
    https://circleci.com/gh/:owner/:repo/tree/:branch.png?circle-token=:circle-token
  %br
  %code
    https://circleci.com/gh/:owner/:repo/tree/:branch.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token

%p
  For example:
  circleci/mongofinil master branch
  %a{ href: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil/tree/master.png?circle-token=b14acf911433d315298235b0c2fbf7b2670a92a8" }
    badge
  and
  %a{ href: "https://circleci.com/gh/circleci/mongofinil/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=b14acf911433d315298235b0c2fbf7b2670a92a8" }
    shield

%p

  One small wrinkle: if your branch name includes characters that are "special" in URLs (most commonly '/') they'll need to be
  %a{ href: "http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp" }
    URL encoded
  when constructing status badge URLs. For example, the badge for a branch called 'feature/nonexistent' would be at '.../tree/feature%2Fnonexistent.png'.

  Access Control

%p
  We recommend creating specific, narrowly scoped API tokens. In fact, we created a whole
  class of tokens just for this purpose: tokens which give read-only access to the build
  status of a single project, and nothing else. You can create and manage these tokens from
  the <b>Project settings &gt; API Tokens</b> page of any project.

%p
  If you prefer, it is also possible to use a user's API token as the circle-token. These
  tokens are very powerful, so only do that in a trusted environment!

%p
  (You can also link to the image without providing a circle-token, in which case the image
  will only appear for people who are currently logged-in to circleci.com!)
