%p
  Circle enables you to automatically deploy after green builds.
  We have customers deploying to PaaSes such as Heroku, Engine Yard,
  and Google App Engine, hosted cloud servers (like EC2 and Rackspace),
  and to private and colo servers&mdash;even behind firewalls.
  Some use tools like Capistrano, Fabric, and Paver.

%p
  However you want to deploy your code, Circle makes
  Continuous Deployment easy.

%h3 Deployment syntax

%p
  Tell Circle about your deployment requirements in the <code>deployment</code>
  section of your
  %a{href: '/docs/configuration'}
    circle.yml
  file.
  Within this section, you can can define custom deployment steps for each
  branch, directing Circle to use specific deployment tools or custom scripts.
  Deployment commands are triggered only after a successful build.


%p
  The following example will run the
  %code deploy-to-production.sh
  script when the tests pass on the master branch and run the
  %code deploy-to-staging.sh
  script when the tests pass on the staging branch.

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      deployment:
        production: # just a label; label names are completely up to you
          branch: master
          commands:
            - ./deploy-to-production.sh
        staging:
          branch: staging
          commands:
            - ./deploy-to-staging.sh

%h3 Deploy over SSH

%p
  First you need to upload your SSH keys from your project's
  <b>Project Settings > SSH keys</b> page in the Circle UI.
  Circle will automatically add them to the <code>ssh-agent</code>,
  so they are available for forwarding.

%p
  You can list commands or include bash scripts for SSH deployment in the
  <code>circle.yml</code> file.
  You can also use tools such as Capistrano or Fabric when deploying to
  private servers or to EC2, Rackspace, and other cloud hosting providers.

%p
  You can use your existing Capistrano recipes, for example:

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      deployment:
        production:
          branch: master
          commands:
            - bundle exec cap production deploy
%p
  Here's an example using Fabric:

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      deployment:
        production:
          branch: master
          commands:
            - fab deploy

%h3 Deploy to a PaaS

%p
  Circle has customers deploying to Heroku, Engine Yard, Google App Engine, Elastic Beanstalk, Dot Cloud, Nodejistu and other PaaSes. We have detailed instructions on
  %a{href: '/docs/continuous-deployment-with-heroku'}
    deployment to Heroku
  and <a href='/docs/deploy-google-app-engine'>deployment to Google App Engine</a>.

%h3 Firewalls, webhooks, and Circle's Public IP address ranges

!= @include_article('ec2ip_and_security_group')

%p
  Use the IP address ranges and security group number as needed to configure
  a physical or in-the-cloud server under your control.
  If you run into any problems,
