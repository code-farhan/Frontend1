%p
  If your build produces persistent artifacts such as screenshots, coverage reports, or
  deployment tarballs, we can automatically save and link them for you.

%p
  Before each build, we create an empty directory and export its path in the
  read-only <code>$CIRCLE_ARTIFACTS</code>
  != succeed ".", ->
    %a{ href: "/docs/environment-variables" } environment variable

%p
  If you prefer, you can also
  %a{ href: "/docs/configuration#artifacts" } configure directories and files whose contents will
  be saved.

%p
  After the build finishes, everything in these directories is saved and linked to the build.

%P
  %img.artifacts-image{src: assetPath('(asset-path "img/docs/artifacts.png")')}
%p
  You'll find links to the artifacts at the top of the build page. You can also consume them
  via our
  != succeed ".", ->
    %a{ href: "/docs/api#build-artifacts" }<
      API

%p
  That's all there is to it!
