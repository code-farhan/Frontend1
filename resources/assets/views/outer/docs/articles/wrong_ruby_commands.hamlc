%p
  CircleCI infers your test settings from the code in your repository, typically looking at the packages you use.
  Most problems occur when there is some error in how the packages are specified.

%p
  If you require custom commands, it obviously won't be possible for CircleCI to infer them correctly.
  In that case, you can
  %a{href: "/docs/configuration"} specify your commands
  using a
  %code circle.yml
  file.

%p
  If you feel we should have inferred your commands correctly, your project may diverge slightly from what we expect.
  Some of the most common problems:


%h2#missing-gemfile-lock Do you have a Gemfile.lock checked in?

%p
  If you only have a Gemfile checked in, it is easy for us to make mistakes.
  This commonly causes us to call
  %code spec
  instead of
  != succeed ',', ->
    %code rspec
  or use the wrong database.
  You should check in your Gemfile.lock if possible, or manually add your test steps.



%h2#wrong-dependencies Have you listed all your dependencies?
%p
  CircleCI always prefixes its commands with
  != succeed '.', ->
    %code bundle exec
  This ensures that the only gems used are the ones specified in the Gemfile.
  Unfortunately, developers commonly omit gems from their Gemfiles, but do not notice because they have them installed locally.
  Run your test command locally with the
  %code bundle exec
  prefix to check this (if it works locally with that command, this isn't the problem).

%h2#wrong-groups Are you using the correct groups?
%p
  Bundler only requires gems that are in the
  %code :test
  group.
  This includes all gems that have no specified group, or that explicitly specify the
  %code :test
  group.
  A common problem is to need gems which have only been put in the
  %code :development
  or
  %code :assets
  group.



%h2#wrong-database
  Do you have two databases in your
  %code :test
  group?

%p
  This can often lead to incorrectly setting up databases, in particular, creating an incorrect
  %code database.yml
  file.
