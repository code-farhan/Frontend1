  This is an issue with the selenium-webdriver gem.
  As Firefox updates to newer revisions, the interface used by selenium-webdriver can break.
  Fortunately, the fix is pretty easy.

%p
  Update to a new version of the selenium-webdriver gem in your Gemfile, if possible to the latest version.
  There are known issues with using anything older than version 2.32.0 of this gem.
  Updating to the
  %a{href: "http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver"}
    latest revision
  is probably your best bet.
