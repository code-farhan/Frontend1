  By default, Circle times out tests if they have not produced output for 180
  seconds. <code>cabal test</code>, even with <code>--show-details=always</code>,
  only produces output as each test suite completes, so it may be necessary
  to
  %a{href: "/docs/configuration#modifiers"}set a higher timeout for commands
  that run it:

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      test:
        override:
          - cabal test:
              timeout: 300
%p
  Note that inferred <code>cabal test</code> commands are already set to time
  out only after 10 minutes without output, so this is only necessary if
  you override the inferred commands, run <code>cabal test</code> elsewhere,
  or have a particular cabal test suite that you expect to take longer than
  10 minutes.
