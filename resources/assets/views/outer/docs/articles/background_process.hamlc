  Starting a background process from
  %a{ href: "/docs/configuration" }
    circle.yml
  is entirely possible, but it is not done by adding
  %code &amp;
  to the end of your command line.   

  Instead, you set the background flag on the command.  For example:
  
%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        post:
          - ./daemon:
              background: true

%p

  If your server takes more than a moment to start, it might be worth adding a
  %code sleep
  to prevent problems when the tests start:

%pre
  %code.no-highlight<>
    :preserve
      machine:
        post:
          - ./daemon:
              background: true
          - sleep 5

%p

  Or better yet, block at the start of your test suite until the
  connection is available.  This speeds up your tests by starting them
  in parallel with your daemon, but doesn't suffer from any race
  conditions where your tests start before your daemon does.

%p
  If you do not redirect stdout and stderr in the command, they are captured
  into files in the artifact directory.  (e.g., "stdout_daemon_7452.txt")

%p
  (Explanation: The background flag prevents your process being killed
  in the remote environment.  If a process is running (even in the
  background) when the remote connection is closed, it will get killed
  by the hangup (HUP) signal.  The background flag uses the "nohup"
  command to prevent this.  The command that gets issued is similar to
  %code nohup bash -c "./daemon &"
  )
